Let your visitors like, comment and share on facebook from a neat slide-in panel.

== Description ==

The Facebook Panel plugin sticks a Facebook icon to the left edge of the window, across every page of the site. When the icon is clicked, a panel comes sliding in featuring the official Facebook Like and Share buttons and Comments widget.

Currently, the following customization options are available:
1. Site owners can activate/deactivate the plugin from within the options page
2. Site owners can adjust the width of the panel
3. Site owners can choose between two modes:
   (a) "OVER"  --> the panel slides in from the left, overlying the page.
   (b) "UNDER" --> the page slides out to the right, revealing the panel underneath. 

Further options are planned for later releases.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the extracted archive to "/wp-content/plugins/"
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in your wp-admin
3. Open the options page through the "Facebook Panel" menu 
4. Adjust settings to your liking
